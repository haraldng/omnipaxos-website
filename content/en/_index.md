## Our mission
OmniPaxos is a software library that simplifies replication and fault-tolerance of distributed systems, which are challenging tasks when building highly-available services. Our aim is to empower developers by providing them with a comprehensive set of tools and abstractions, making it easy to build reliable, fault-tolerant, and consistent systems. With OmniPaxos, developers no longer need to worry about the complexities of replication and consensus; we provide an API that makes replication as simple as working with an append-only log.
